fly me to the moon
and let me sing among the stars
let me see what spring is
like on jupiter and mars
in other words: hold my hand!
in other words:
baby kiss me!
fill my heart with song.
and let me sing forever more
you are all I long for all i
worship and adore
in other words: please be true!
in other words: I love you!

fill my heart with song.
and let me sing forever more
you are all I long for all i
worship and adore
in other words: please be true!
in other words:
in other words: I love you!
